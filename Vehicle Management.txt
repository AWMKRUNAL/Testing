Problem : My problem Statement: So basically, I worked in company lived in Raigarh Chhattisgarh now there are around 11 vehicles for 60 employees to travel from raigarh to site office which is around 60km from raigarh these employees live in different parts of raigarh and in each vehicle who will come is decidedand changes around 2 -3 months duration some vehicles have 4 some may have 5 like that now problem is that suppose in some employee is on leave then seat remains vacant as no one knows so if employees get notified that there is seat vacant then they can shift to that vehicle this is now done over phone calls by one member. also suppose out of total 4-5 employees are on leave then by managing them we can save 140 km travel by an vehicle and we can save money. Now this is one-part other part is that after arrival on site office as its coal mine some may go to site or any other other work then they dont know availabity of vehicle whether it is present on parking or who taken it so there is time waste so need to make a uber like app where employee will share from to where he has to go then driver will accept or reject based on availability in first case employee address is saved and in second case employee needs to select from where to where he has to travel and based on this trip will be accepted also driver must have feature to enter hmr readings for each travel for log books did you understand suggestions are accepted
